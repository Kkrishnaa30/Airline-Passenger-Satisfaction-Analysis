# 🟧✈️ **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis – Orange Workflow Project**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer satisfaction in the **airline industry** using an **interactive, no-code workflow** built entirely in **Orange Data Mining**. With data from over **120,000 airline passengers**, the goal is to identify **key factors** that drive satisfaction or dissatisfaction and provide **strategic recommendations** for improving customer experience.

All analysis, modeling, and visualizations were conducted using Orange's **visual programming interface**, making the project ideal for **non-programmers**, educators, and data enthusiasts.

## 🧰 Tools Used

### 🟧 **Orange Data Mining**

Orange is a powerful open-source data visualization and analysis tool for both novice and expert users. It provides an intuitive **drag-and-drop canvas** for building end-to-end machine learning workflows.

### 🧩 Key Widgets Used

* **File & Select Columns** – Load and structure the dataset
* **Data Table** – View raw and processed data
* **Distributions, Box Plot & Scatter Plot** – Explore feature relationships and outliers
* **Rank** – Identify most important attributes influencing satisfaction
* **Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM** – Train and compare classification models
* **Test & Score** – Evaluate model performance using accuracy, AUC, precision, and recall
* **Confusion Matrix & ROC Analysis** – Visualize classification results

## 📈 Key Project Objectives

✔ Understand the **distribution of customer satisfaction**
✔ Identify **which features most impact** satisfaction (e.g., cleanliness, delays, service)
✔ Compare models to predict satisfaction labels (Satisfied vs. Dissatisfied)
✔ Visualize insights using Orange’s **interactive plots and score metrics**
✔ Present strategic recommendations to airlines for service improvement

## 🔍 Key Insights Discovered

* ✅ **Business class travelers** reported significantly higher satisfaction
* ✅ **Arrival delay** and **flight distance** were among the top negative factors
* ✅ **Cleanliness and seat comfort** had the highest positive influence
* ✅ **Older passengers** tended to report higher satisfaction
* ✅ **Logistic Regression and SVM** delivered strong prediction performance with balanced accuracy

---

## 💡 Recommendations

🔸 Improve **on-time performance**, especially reducing arrival delays
🔸 Focus on **cleanliness and comfort upgrades** across classes
🔸 Segment marketing efforts by **travel type** and **passenger demographics**
🔸 Use classification model outputs to **proactively target at-risk customer segments**
